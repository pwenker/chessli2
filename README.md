# Welcome to Chessli2 🏰

Chessli2 is your **always free** and **open-source** chess trainer 🛡️, designed to elevate your game by allowing you to analyze games, identify mistakes, and sharpen your tactics, all sourced directly from [lichess.org](https://lichess.org/).

## Why a second version?

Incredibly, despite my prolonged absence, I continue to receive heartfelt 💌 thank you notes and eager requests for `chessli`. 
This overwhelming support has inspired me to develop a sleek new version of Chessli that not only squashes all those pesky bugs 🐛 but also introduces a user-friendly graphical interface. This means no programming experience is required to dive in!

## Features 🌟

- **Automatically fetch your games and played tactics puzzles** from lichess via the [berserk python client](https://github.com/lichess-org/berserk) for the Lichess API! 🔄
- **Find your mistakes** by parsing and analyzing your games with [python-chess](https://github.com/niklasf/python-chess) 🔍
- **Leverage the power of spaced repetition** using [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) with this amazing interactive chess template: [Anki-Chess-2.0](https://github.com/TowelSniffer/Anki-Chess-2.0) 🧠
